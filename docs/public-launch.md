# Public launch plan

Start here when returning to the project. The public release is already available.

## Launch sequence — October 6, 2026

The owner authorized publication of the prepared launch material on October 6.
The approved cover is the monochrome version. Public posts must describe the current
app, disclose authorship and ask for practical feedback. Keep donation links on GitHub
and Ko-fi. Record each actual publication URL in the launch log.

| Order | Destination | Material | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ko-fi profile | Install the approved black-and-white cover; retain the English About and bug/idea links. | Now, after owner login. |
| 2 | r/software Weekly Discovery Thread | Short introduction: saved display modes, hotkeys, automatic app/game rules, GitHub link and one feedback question. | First community publication, after verifying live rules and account access. |
| 3 | r/SideProject | Standalone project post with the real Modes UI screenshot and a request for first-setup feedback. | After reviewing the first replies, normally at least 48 hours later. |
| 4 | Recent relevant display-workflow discussions | Answer a specific question about presets, hotkeys or automatic rules; disclose that you develop DeskModes. | Only when the current app fits the actual question. |
| 5 | r/Windows11 | Ask moderators whether a practical Windows display-workflow demonstration fits. | Before an announcement there. |

Do not send duplicate promotions across many threads. Use the existing GitHub bug and
suggestion forms for feedback. Review the first replies before expanding the launch;
useful setup reports and recurring obstacles matter more than raw download counts.

Browser access on October 6: Chrome is not connected to control. Reddit's in-app page
shows a CAPTCHA, and Ko-fi Settings requires login. The pages are open for the owner;
neither an outreach post nor the new cover has been published during this attempt.

## Ready-to-use materials

| Need | Open |
| --- | --- |
| Copy a post, invitation or reply | [Launch copy](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/launch-copy.md) |
| Attach screenshots or record a short demo | [Content checklist](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/launch-content.md) |
| See completed checks and remaining owner actions | [Launch log](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/launch-log.md) |
| Fill in Ko-fi | [English page copy](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/kofi-page.md) |
| Review the next app release | [1.0.2 release verification](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/next-release.md) |

## Next owner actions, in order

1. The Ko-fi profile text is saved. Finish owner verification requirements, check the
   public checkout and finish the prepared cover upload. No shop or membership is needed.
2. Both GitHub forms passed browser checks and test submissions are closed. Watch →
   Custom → Issues is saved. Confirm notification delivery from a different account.
3. Use the Modes screenshot for the first post. A real 20-second demo can follow;
   the shot list and captions are ready in the content checklist.
4. Choose one community below, paste its matching draft, read the current rules again
   and stay available for replies. Record the actual post URL in the launch log.

## Where to go

Rules checked on 2026-10-04. Recheck on the day of posting. The agent has prepared
materials and has not sent invitations, contacted moderators or published community posts.

Publication is now authorized. Start with one short comment in the current
r/software Weekly Discovery Thread, or the r/SideProject draft and Modes screenshot.
After 48 hours of feedback, adapt the next post using what people actually found useful
or confusing. Keep announcements about the available app and disclose authorship.

| Priority | Destination | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First option | [r/software Weekly Discovery Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1wvquoc/weekly_discovery_thread_october_02_2026/) | Relevant side projects and transparent self-promotion are allowed. Keep the comment short and personal; the thread prohibits link spam and AI-generated content dumps. Use the short draft; recheck the active weekly thread before posting. |
| Alternative first post | [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) · [create post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/submit) | Share the project and ask for feedback. Its [sidebar](https://old.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) requests a project name followed by a short description for link submissions. Use the matching draft and Modes screenshot. |
| Later | [r/software](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/) · [create post](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/submit) | Current rules allow open-source software promotion and reserve Release posts for new programs or substantial updates. DeskModes is free and MIT licensed. Use the software draft and appropriate Release flair; do not repost each patch. There is an undisclosed account-karma threshold. |
| Optional | [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit) · [guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html) | Submit the runnable project and be available to discuss it. Write your own text: the [moderator's guidance](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336638) says not to use LLM-generated or edited text on HN. The copy file provides facts, not an HN post. Do not request upvotes. |
| Ask first | [r/Windows11](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/) · [message moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FWindows11) | Current rules say Windows compatibility alone does not make a post relevant. Ask whether a display-workflow demo fits. The [October help thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1wuxl8s/simple_questions_and_help_thread_month_of_october/) is for help; do not treat it as a launch thread. |
| Direct feedback | Existing friends or communities you participate in | Invite 5–10 willing Windows multi-monitor users with the tester draft. The owner chooses recipients; no private chat or contact list is assumed. |

GitHub Issues provides one public place for bugs and suggestions; a new support chat
is not needed for this launch. If a post is removed, read the reason and use the community's
moderator route where appropriate instead of repeatedly submitting it.

Goal: help Windows users with several displays understand the value, try one mode,
and report whether it works on their desk. This is an outreach plan, not a compatibility promise.

## GitHub front page

The README leads with one use case, a release link and the current Modes screenshot.
Detailed setup and recovery live in docs/getting-started.md; technical options stay in
docs/reference.md. The screenshots are rendered from the real UI with invented monitors,
not evidence of validation on those monitor models.

Suggested repository About description:

> Switch between Work, Game and TV display setups with one hotkey. Portable Windows app that remembers layouts, refresh rates and window positions.

Use https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/releases/latest as the About website.
Keep the existing focused topics: windows, powershell, multi-monitor, monitor-switcher,
display-profiles, hotkeys and ddc-ci. Keep the public issue channel enabled.

## Feedback acceptance

- The released app opens the repository Issues page from Settings → About.
- README links directly to the Bug report and Feature request forms.
- Bug reports require the symptom, reproduction steps and version. Diagnostics,
  logs and hardware details are optional so startup failures can still be reported.
- Confirm the bug and enhancement labels exist, and the templates are on main.
- Create one clearly marked test issue with no real diagnostics, then close it.
  This checks issue creation and closure, not browser form validation.
- In a signed-in browser, open each README feedback link. Verify the correct form
  renders, empty required fields block submission, and a report without logs is allowed.
- In GitHub, select Watch → Custom → Issues for the maintainer account. Check
  notification delivery with a report from another account; self-authored issues
  do not establish notification delivery.
- Review new issues daily during the first week. Ask for only the missing details,
  add a workaround when known, and link a fix to its release.

A successful API smoke check does not prove the browser form or email notifications.
Browser forms and the Issues subscription passed on October 4. Delivery from another
account still needs checking before describing the entire feedback path as verified.

## Enable voluntary support

The support page is https://ko-fi.com/gentlemec. The owner reports PayPal and Stripe
connected on 2026-10-03. Profile text and its Website link were saved and verified in the
browser. Outstanding payment verification, signed-out checkout and receipt remain owner
checks. Registration, identity checks, payment setup and transactions are owner actions.

The English page title, description, feedback links and thank-you message are ready in
[docs/kofi-page.md](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/kofi-page.md).

GitHub FUNDING.yml and the README link to this page. The released 1.0.2 About button uses the same URL.
Its tag workflow and downloaded archive checks passed; payment acceptance is separate.

Remaining owner checks:

1. Finish the prepared cover upload and verify the saved thank-you message.
2. Resolve outstanding owner verification and review currency, tip amount and fees.
3. Confirm the public page offers both payment methods and check for any outstanding
   payment-provider requirements. Confirm receipt after a genuine supporter payment.

Official setup:

DeskModes remains free; support is optional and grants no promise of priority fixes.


## First two weeks

| Window | Action | Observable result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Days 1–2 | Publish the concise README and current screenshots; finish the feedback and notification checks; set up the support page. | A visitor can find the ZIP, understand one use case and report a problem. |
| Days 2–3 | Record a 15–25 second demonstration: Work → Game → Back. Show the hotkey, resulting screens and restored arrangement. Hide personal desktop content. | One short real-hardware clip, with captions and a GitHub link. |
| Days 3–5 | Share with 5–10 willing users who have different Windows display setups. Ask them to create one mode, switch away and back, then describe the result. | Setup reports with monitor models, connection types and Windows version. |
| Days 5–7 | Publish one focused post in a relevant community after reading its current promotion rules. Adapt the clip and use case to that audience. | Useful questions and reproducible reports rather than unexplained download counts. |
| Week 2 | Fix the most common setup obstacle, update the guide, and publish a patch if needed. Share one follow-up with the result. | A shorter first-run path and evidence from desks beyond the author's. |

Potential audiences to assess: Windows multi-monitor users, gaming/workstation
communities and open-source desktop-tool communities. Check current rules and any
self-promotion restrictions immediately before posting. This document does not authorize
sending messages or posting announcements; the owner chooses the accounts and channels.

## Draft announcement

Use the matching platform draft in [Launch copy](https://github.com/GentleMec/DeskModes/blob/main/docs/launch-copy.md).
The drafts cover custom modes, hotkeys and rules, with hardware controls described as optional.
Keep the donation link on GitHub and Ko-fi; the first community post asks for product feedback.

## What to measure

Use GitHub release asset downloads, the repository's available traffic view, reported
successful setups, reproducible bugs and repeated questions. Downloads are not active users.
Traffic data may include the maintainer's own checks. Keep a baseline before the first post.

A useful first target is five independent successful setup reports and a clear view of the
three most common obstacles. Stars and voluntary contributions are secondary signals.
Pause wider outreach if reports show inaccessible desktops, failed recovery or lost settings;
document the workaround and verify a fix before the next round. Add no application telemetry
just to measure the launch.

## Verification record — 2026-10-02

Public repository, released 1.0.1 ZIP/checksum and successful release/check workflows confirmed.
The existing bug and enhancement labels are present. API smoke issue #1 was created
with the bug label and closed as completed. About description and release link updated.
Local tools/check.ps1 passed with 2,850 assertions; the local analyzer was unavailable.
Signed-in browser form validation and notification delivery remain owner checks because
the browser tool could not verify its saved access permissions. The public chooser
redirects signed-out visitors to GitHub sign-in. At that snapshot, the support page URL was pending.
